                                SpreSkill takes appropriate security and technical measures to protect your information from unauthorized 
                                access, loss and misuse. In addition, we request that our suppliers who process personal information on our 
                                behalf take a range of security measures designed to help protect your personal information and maintain an 
                                appropriate level of security. However, we cannot guarantee the absolute security of your information online 
                                and offline, as the Internet by its nature is not a secure environment and the nature of security risks is 
                                constantly evolving. As such you should always take care when sharing your information online.
